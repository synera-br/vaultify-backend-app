# Option 1: Path to service account file
# Ensure this path is correct and the file is accessible by the application.
# For local development, you might place it in the project root or a config directory.
# For production, ensure the file is securely managed and deployed.

# Option 2: Base64 encoded service account JSON
# Use this if you prefer to provide the service account credentials as a single environment variable,

# Important: Only set this if GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS is NOT set.

# This key MUST be a Base64 encoded 32-byte string for AES-256 encryption.
# Generate a secure random key and then Base64 encode it.
# Example (in Go):
#   key := make([]byte, 32)
#   _, err := rand.Read(key)
#   if err != nil { panic(err) }
#   encodedKey := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(key)
#   fmt.Println(encodedKey)
